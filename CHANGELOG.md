- Fix a typo in the mod renaming warning.
- Add a few new methods to the `JamLibPlatform.Platform` enum.
- `JamLib` is no longer entirely `ApiStatus.Internal` (there are some stable API methods in there. Non-stable public internal methods are annotated as such).
- Build system improvements.
- Update the icon again.
